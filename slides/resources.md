Note: That build tool is available through npm, and the source is up on GitHub, so feel free to go in, try it out on your own applications, let us know what sort of performance gains you see, or if there are any issues.  If you look at the history, you can see this is still really new, so we're definitely looking for feedback on any of this.

In addition to the build tool, all the yaoman generators Gavin was talking about are open source and available on npm.  If there's a feature you're looking for, but hasn't been implemented yet, go ahead and create an issue.  If its something you really need, please go in and make a pull request.  We're more than happy to integrate your code and improvements and really make these tools a community project.

The Web App Builder community is something that's realy taken off in the last couple years.  Especially in GeoNet.  There are a number of users publishiing really great widgets there, maintaining them, and listening to community feedback and requests.  Take advantage of this.  All of the best development best practices can't compare to just using something a community has already developed.

Finally, we have a couple of documentation links up here.  When I'm devloping new widgets, these sites take up at least half of my hundreds of browser tabs.  The Web App Builder site gives you some of the specific event information and JSON config that comes with Web App Builder, but where you're goinig to be spending the majority of your time is in the JavaScript API.  Again, that's really what this is: JavaScript API Development with the Web App Builder Framework backing you up.
