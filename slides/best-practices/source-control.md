## Source Control
### Save your code

Note: Using Git or some other source control system is one of the first and most powerful steps you can take towards improving your development workflows.

Being able to track feature branches, revert changes, and avoid code conflicts between team members will make life much easier, not just for you, but for anyone else that will have to program, test, or deploy your applications.

### Only save *your* code

Note: We still see a large number of projects saving an entire web app builder application on Git.  However, by only committing the widget you're working on into source control, your repository becomes less cluttered, your widget becomes more portable, and core product upgrades become easier. 

Additionally, keeping your code separate takes away the temptation to modify out of the box Web App Builder Functionality, which can cause unexpected bugs across the application, as well as creating a potential nightmare of an upgrade path.

Luckily, as we saw in the previous demos, the generator tool helps set everything up for you.
